## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the project running locally.

### Prerequisites

You will need a Google Gemini API key.
- Get a free API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/iamaanahmad/CertificateGenerator.git
   cd CertificateGenerator
   ```

2. **API Key Configuration:**
   This application is designed to be deployed on a platform (like Vercel, Netlify, Glitch, or a custom Node.js server) that can securely inject environment variables into the frontend code.

   You must set an environment variable named `API_KEY` with your Google Gemini API key. The application code in `services/geminiService.ts` expects `process.env.API_KEY` to be available.

3. **Run Locally:**
   You can use any simple local web server to run the project.
   ```sh
   # If you have Node.js, you can use `npx`
   npx serve .
   ```
   Open your browser to the local address provided by the server.

   ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important for Local Development:** A simple static server like `serve` will **not** replace `process.env.API_KEY`. For local testing, you might need to temporarily replace `process.env.API_KEY` in `services/geminiService.ts` with your key string. **Remember to not commit your API key to your repository!**
